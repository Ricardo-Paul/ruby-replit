# Using some ruby feature to improve the strategy pattern

# Our strategy classes are currently implemented as ruby classes, classes are objects that contain code, so are Procs. We can then switch to a proc-based implementation. Eliminating the needs for classes altogether.

# So now we donâ€™t have a class with a method to call, but just a Proc to call.
